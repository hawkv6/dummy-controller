# Hawkv6 Dummy Controller
This is a dummy controller for the Hawkv6 project. It is intended to be used as a test controller for the hawkwing project. It is not intended to be used in a production environment.

## Overview
The dummy controller is intended to be used as a test controller which will return pre-defined data to the hawkwing client. This is useful for testing the hawkwing client without having to setup a full controller. A simple CLI driven UI allows for changing SID list values and testing the event-driven update mechanism.
